Audit the code for potential security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and adherence to best practices. Provide a detailed report with recommendations for improvements.

Review the following aspects:

1. Security
   - Check for exposed secrets or sensitive data
   - Validate input handling to prevent injection attacks
   - Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Review error handling to avoid information leakage
   - Verify use of secure libraries and dependencies

2. Performance
   - Identify and optimize slow or inefficient code paths
   - Analyze memory usage and detect potential leaks
   - Review database queries for performance issues
   - Evaluate caching strategies and their effectiveness

3. Best Practices
   - Ensure adherence to coding standards and style guides
   - Review documentation for completeness and clarity
   - Evaluate test coverage and effectiveness
   - Identify opportunities for code simplification and refactoring

Provide a comprehensive report summarizing findings and actionable recommendations for each area reviewed.
Use the following format for the report:

## Security
- [Finding 1]
  - Recommendation: [Actionable recommendation]
- [Finding 2]
