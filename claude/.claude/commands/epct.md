Please follow this structured development approach for: $argument

## Phase 1: Explore
- Research the current codebase and relevant patterns
- Identify existing similar implementations
- Understand dependencies and constraints
- Document key findings and considerations

## Phase 2: Plan
- Design the implementation approach
- Break down into manageable tasks
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Create a detailed execution timeline

## Phase 3: Code
- Implement the solution following our coding standards
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Include appropriate error handling and edge cases
- Follow our established patterns and conventions

## Phase 4: Test
- Create comprehensive unit tests
- Add integration tests where appropriate
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Verify performance meets requirements

Provide detailed output for each phase before proceeding to the next.
