```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<comment>"
```

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<comment>"
```


    Security: ED25519 keys are more secure against PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) failures, making them a robust choice for SSH keys.
    Performance: ED25519 keys are faster and more efficient than RSA keys, which can be a significant advantage in environments with high security requirements 2.
    Compatibility: Ensure your system supports the key type you choose. ED25519 is supported in OpenSSH version 6.5 and later, while RSA keys are widely supported across all versions 2.

```bash
ssh -V
```
